Brightens up a certain area in the Echos of the Eye DLC for Outer Wilds.

The mod has configurable settings:
- See sun: Doesn't affect lighting, just lets you see the sun in the sky.
- Sun angle: from 0 to 180 degrees across the sky, affects shadows.
- Sun intensity: from 0 for complete darkness to 1 for very bright
- Shadow intensity: from 0 for no shadows to 1 for very hard shadows
- See solar system: Lets you see all other planets in the sky (off by default)
- Dream at any campfire: Something I used for debugging but I left it in for fun (off by default)
